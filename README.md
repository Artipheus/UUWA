# Useless Utilities Web App (UUWA)
A Website that contains random utilities.
It's still WIP.

Current utilities that will be implemented:
* Random Number Generator (I have an obsession with random numbers).
* Note utility (couldn't come up with a good name for it).
* Calculator (who doesn't like calculators).
* IP Address Calculator (I recently finished a networking course, so that was stuck in my mind)
* IP Address & DNS 'getter' (I don't know if this is possible with JAMStack)

I was thinking of creating a ping utility but a quick search made it clear that that will require a web server (I don't think it's possible with JAMStack).

Most utilities will have a history table that will contain values the user has saved (they will probably be saved by default). It will probably be done using IndexedDB.
